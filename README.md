Hi, my name is Nikita, and I am a developer. Read more about me
[on my website°](https://www.kytta.dev/).  
**I am not looking for a job**, so don't try to contact me about it; my respond,
if present, will be passive-aggressive at best :)

I am using GitHub under protest.

Many of my projects are still hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub
is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software.
I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop
my FOSS projects. I have a [profile on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kytta/),
where I am currently migrating my projects to. All my repositories on GitHub
will be eventually replaced with mirrors. 

I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without
my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of my code in Copilot.
