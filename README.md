Hello!

My name is **Nikita** and I am a Front End Web Developer. I'm studying CS in Germany and in my spare time I develop and maintain JS and TS libraries. Among other things, I have created and currently maintain

* [📯 shareon](https://shareon.js.org) — lightweight and ethical social sharing buttons,
* [🌌 vue-tinybox](https://os.karamoff.dev/vue-tinybox) — the smallest lightbox gallery component for Vue.js, and
* [🌍 vavilon.js](https://vavilon.js.org) — an i18n engine for static and serverless websites.

You can find out a little bit more about me [on my website](https://karamoff.dev). The most convenient way to reach out to me is [via e-mail](mailto:github@karamoff.dev) or [via Telegram](https://t.me/NickKaramoff).
